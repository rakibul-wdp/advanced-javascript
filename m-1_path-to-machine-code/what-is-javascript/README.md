# What is JavaScript

### High Abstraction

- High abstraction -> less control
- Low abstraction -> more control
- Does not need any resource management and memory allocation.

### Garbage Collected

- It means that we don't need to worry about garbage cleanup. An algorithm inside JavaScript take care of garbage collection and cleaning.
